### Transformations or work that performed to clean up the data
-Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-Usesed descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-Created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
